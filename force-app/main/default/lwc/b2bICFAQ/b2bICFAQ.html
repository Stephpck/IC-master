                    <lightning-accordion-section name="N" label="What is whole body cryotherapy?">
                        <p>Cryotherapy is the practice of using cold temperatures to support healing and wellness and dates back to ancient civilizations. Whole body cryotherapy is the modern application and stimulates the same rejuvenating and recovery benefits at a whole new level of cold in just three minutes.</p>

                    <lightning-accordion-section name="O" label="Is it like an ice bath?">
                        <p>Whole body cryotherapy is similar to an ice bath in that it is a cold therapy. There are key differences. A whole body cryotherapy session is a maximum of three-minutes and an ice-bath is is a maximum of twenty-minutes. Cryotherapy is a dry, painless cold and an ice-bath, at a minimum, is uncomfortable. Whole body cryotherapy cold only penetrates the top layers of skin; an ice bath penetrates into the muscles and joints which introduces the potential for tissue damage and the potential to lower the body’s core temperature. Whole body cryotherapy cold dissipates quickly; ice bath cold dissipates gradually.</p>
